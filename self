 SELF INTRODUCTION

“Good Morning, thank you for giving me this opportunity.
My name is Mani krishna.  I am a DevOps Trainee and hands-on experience on DevOps tools.

I have practical experience in Linux , Git, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, AWS, and Kubernetes.

In my current role, I am responsible for CI/CD pipeline creation using Jenkins, containerizing applications using Docker, and deploying applications on Kubernetes clusters.

I have worked extensively on Linux servers, handling user management, permissions, services, logs, and troubleshooting production issues.

On AWS, I have experience working with EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling, and integrating AWS services into CI/CD pipelines.

I also worked on Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and configuration management using Ansible to automate deployments.

 I consciously upgraded my skills and IT career. Today, I am fully committed to growing as a DevOps engineer and contributing strongly to my next organization.

I am now looking for a role where I can take more responsibility in Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud operations, and grow technically as well as professionally.
